\n\
This plugin calculates the Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) of 8x8 blocks of\n\
the image data, and embeds the message data in the least significant bit (LSB)\n\
of the calculated DCTs.\n\
\n\
DctLSB Plugin affects the existing OpenStego options in the following way:\n\
\n\
\    -cf, --coverfile <filename>\n\
\        If this option is not provided or ''-'' (without quotes) is provided as\n\
\        the value then a random image containing noise is generated and used\n\
\        as cover file\n\
\n\
\    -sf, --stegofile <filename>\n\
\        If this option is not provided or ''-'' (without quotes) is provided as\n\
\        the value then stego file is written to stdout in PNG format
